'![not found](https://github.com/Vigneshk5/todo-app/blob/main/images/Screenshot%202023-05-07%20at%2011.51.45%20AM.png)'

## Overview

This is a simple todo app that allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the frontend, and Node.js and MongoDB on the backend.

## Functionality

The app has the following functionality:

- Add a new task
- Edit an existing task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Show all tasks

## Code Structure

The code for this app is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the app's UI
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the app's UI
- `code.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the app's frontend functionality
- `script.js`: The Node.js file that contains the server-side functionality
- `todo.js`: The MongoDB schema and model for tasks

## HTML

The HTML for this app is a simple form that allows the user to add a new task and a table that displays the list of tasks

## CSS

The CSS for this app is a simple set of styles that make the UI look clean and organized. The styles include a background colour, font family, padding, and margins.

## JavaScript

### Frontend

The frontend JavaScript is responsible for interacting with the server-side API to add, edit, delete, and display tasks. It uses `fetch` to make HTTP requests to the server.

### Backend

The backend of the app is built with Node.js and MongoDB. The server is responsible for handling HTTP requests and interfacing with the MongoDB database. The database schema and model for tasks is defined in `model/todo.js`.

## Conclusion

This is a basic todo app that demonstrates how to use MongoDB with Node.js to create a server-side API for a web application.
